class:

# What is descriptive statistics?

--

- **Descriptive statistics** is a collection of statistical measures and tools used to give us a better sense of the sampled data

--

- Not to be confused with **inferential statistics** where we are trying to reach
conclusions that extend beyond the sampled data

---

# Why descriptive statistics ?

--

- Provides an understanding of the underlying sample population

--

- Simplifies large amounts of data to a simpler summary

--

- Identifies potential measurement errors or mistakes

---

# Types of Data

```{r, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/variable_types.png')
```

---

# Types of Data

### Quantitative (Numeric)

Variable that has been measured on a numeric or quantitative scale

--

#### **Continuous** 
  
- Can theoretically take on an infinite number of values - accuracy is limited only by the measuring instrument 
  - e.g. age, BMI, BSA, height, weight, etc..

--

#### **Discrete** 
- Numerical variables that are measured and can only be whole numbers 
  - e.g. age, heart rate, number of medication taken, number of relapses, etc..


---
# Types of Data

### Qualitative (Categorical)

Variables that are typically not directly measured by an instrument, and are based on observations

--

#### **Ordinal** 
- Variables that have an inherent hierarchical order to the relationship among the different categories 
  - e.g. pain scores, stage of cancer, education level, etc..

--

#### **Nominal** 
- Variables that are "named" or classified into one or more qualitative groups
- Do not have a sense of ordering between the different categories
  - e.g. risk factors, types of medications consumed, types of symptoms experienced, surgical outcomes, blood type, gender, etc..

---
# Types of Data

### Why do we need to identify the types of data ? 

--

- In statistics we have specialized tools or measures to handle different type of data 

--

- You will **NEED** to understand what kind of data you have in order to correctly summarize your data

---

# Measures of Location

### Mean

--

- The sample mean is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency.

--

- The sample mean can be defined as:

$$\huge \bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}$$

---
# Example Data

```{r}
df %>% knitr::kable()
```

---

# Example

We have a collection of **age** that was collected from the sample population

```{r}
df$age
```

--

* The **total sum** of all of the sampled age is `r sum(df$age)`

--

* The **total number of measurements** collected is `r length(df$age)`

--

* The **mean** or average age among the sample population is `r mean(df$age)`

---

# Measures of Location
### Median

--

- The median is the midpoint of the values 

--
  -  The midpoint value is the point at which half the observations are above the value and half the observations are below the value *(50th percentile*). 
  
--

  - If there are two 'middle' values then the median is the average of the two mid values

---

# Example

Let's recall the collection of **age** that we have collected from the sample population

```{r}
df$age
```

--

* We start by ranking the data from smallest to largest 

```{r}
sort(df$age)
```

--

* We identify the **middle** value from the data

```{r}
sort(df$age)[5:6]
```

--

* We then take the average of the two middle value to obtain the **median**

```{r}
median(df$age)
```

---

# Measures of Location
### Mode

--

- The mode is the value that appears most often in a set of values. 

--

- Not always a measure of central tendency

--

- The mode is only useful for discrete values or continuous values with limited digits of accuracy

--

- It's possible to have more than 1 mode

---

# Example

```{r}
df$age
```

- Let's tabulate the occurences of each of the sampled age

--
```{r}
table(df$age)
```

--

- The mode is the value that occured the most often. 

--

- In our example, the mode is **`r table(df$age)[table(df$age) == max(table(df$age))] %>% names()`**

---
# Measures of Variability or Dispersion

### Minimum and Maximum

--

A measure of dispersion and is defined as the smallest and largest value

---
# Example

```{r}
df$age
```

--

- We will rank the data from smallest to largest

--

```{r}
sort(df$age)
```

--

- The min and max corresponds to the smallest and largest values of our sample. 

--

- In our example, the min would be **`r min(df$age)`**, and the max would be **`r max(df$age)`**

---
# Measures of Variability or Dispersion

### Percentiles / Interquartile Range (IQR)

--

- The interquartile range is defined as the range between the 25th and 75th percentiles

$$\LARGE IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$$ 

--

- It is commonly denoted after presenting the median

--

- The interquartile range can be used to describe the spread of the data. As the spread of the data increases, the IQR becomes larger. 

--

- It is also used to build box plots.

--

- Depending on the statistical software you are using, there are multiple ways of calculating quantile

---
# Example

We determine the interquartile range by calculating quantiles at the 25th and the 75th percentile.

```{r}
df$age
```

--

- We begin by sorting the values

```{r}
sort(df$age)
```

--

- The 25th percentile is the value that divides the data where 25 percent falls below this value and 75 percent falls above this value.

--

- The 75th percentile is the value that divides the data where 75 percent falls below this value and 25 percent falls above this value.

--

```{r}
quantile(df$age, type = 6)
```

--

- The interquantile range is the distance between the value of the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile.

--

- In this example, the IQR is **`r quantile(df$age, .75, type = 6) - quantile(df$age, .25, type = 6)`**

---

# Measures of Variability or Dispersion
### Standard Deviation

The standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the data are about the mean. 

$$\LARGE s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \overline{x})^2}$$

---

# Example

.pull-left[

```{r}
df$age
```

- The mean sample age is **`r mean(df$age)`**

- There is a total of **`r length(df$age)`** measurements

]

--

.pull-right[

```{r}
tibble('age' = df$age,
       'mean_age' = mean(df$age)) %>%
  mutate(
    diff = age - mean_age
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    diff2 = (diff)^2
  )
```

]

---
# Example

```{r}
tibble('age' = df$age,
       'mean_age' = mean(df$age)) %>%
  mutate(diff = age - mean_age) %>%
  mutate(diff2 = (diff) ^ 2) %>%
  summarise(summ_diff2 = sum(diff2)) %>%
  mutate(
    total_length_minus_one = length(df$age) - 1,
    var = summ_diff2 / total_length_minus_one,
    sd = sqrt(var)
  )

```

--

The sample standard deviation is **`r sd(df$age) %>% scales::number(., .01)`**

---
# Example 

```{r}

set.seed(1)
tibble(sd = c(2.08, 10, 15)) %>%
  mutate(data = map(sd, ~ rnorm(500, mean = 34, sd = .x))) %>%
  mutate(label = glue::glue('SD: {sd}')) %>%
  mutate(label = as_factor(label)) %>%
  unnest(data) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = data)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid( ~ label) +
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 34,
    linetype = 'dashed',
    color = 'red',
    size = 1
  ) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 15) + 
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) + 
  labs(x = 'Age', y = 'n', caption = 'Mean: 34')

```

# Presenting / Describing your data

--

- You should always include **BOTH** a *measure of central tendency* and *measure of dispersion* when presenting your data

--

- The choice is dependent on the distribution of your data

--

### Symmetric Distribution

```{r, out.width = '75%', fig.align = 'center'}
set.seed(1)
tibble(x = rnorm(1000, 0)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_void()
```

- mean ± SD
- median (25%, 75% quantiles)
- median (IQR)
- median (min - max)

]

--

.pull-right[
### Asymmetric Distribution

```{r, out.width = '75%', fig.align = 'center'}
set.seed(1)
tibble(x = rlnorm(1000, 0)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_void()

- median (IQR)
- median (min - max)

# Qualitative Data

---

# Summarizing Qualitative Data

--

- The primary method of summarizing qualitative data is frequency **counts** and **percentages**

```{r}
df$sex

```

--

- Let's tabulate the total occurrences of M and F in our data

```{r}
df %>%
  count(sex)
```

--

- Next we take the total and divide by the total number of patients

```{r}
df %>%
  count(sex) %>%
  mutate(
    proportion = n / sum(n),
    proportion = scales::percent(proportion, .1)
  )

# Histogram

.pull-left[

* Useful for all sized data (small and large)

* Allows us to visualize the spread and distribution of continuous variables

* Each bar represents a 'bin' or a defined interval of values

* Although not as common, the width of the bins does NOT have to be equal!

* The y axis or the height of the bar represents the count of the number of values that fall into each bin
  
* The y axis is also commonly normalized to 'relative' frequencies to show the proportion of cases or density that falls into each bin.
